# Cplusplus-Codes
C++ codes covering important topics. <br />
These are all the codes that I coded when I studied this language. <br />
These Codes contain topics like: <br />
  --> Classes and Objects (OOPs) <br />
  --> Inheritance <br />
  --> Polymorphism <br />
  --> Pointers <br />
  --> Function Overloading <br />
  --> Operator Overloading <br />
  --> Virtual Functions <br />
  --> Abstract Classes <br />
  --> Dynamic Memory Allocation <br />
  --> Standard Template Library <br />
  --> Vectors, Lists, Maps <br />
  --> Function Objects (Functors) <br />
  --> File Handling <br />
  and many more other topics <br />
Each File contains comment to help understand the code written <br />
